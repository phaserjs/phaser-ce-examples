# Phaser Example Repository

This is the Phaser Examples repository. It contains *only* examples, and no mechanism to run them.

- To run the latest published examples visit the [Online Phaser Examples][online-examples].

- To run these examples locally with additional developer support, primarily for development on the Phaser library or example repository itself, use the [Phaser Examples Playground][playground] project.

If looking for the Phaser framework itself, visit the [Phaser github repository][phaser-git] or the [official Phaser Website][phaser-web].

## Learn By Example

Phaser comes with an ever growing suite of Examples. Personally we feel that you learn better by looking at small refined code examples. So we created over 250 of them, and create new ones to test nearly every feature added to Phaser. Inside this `examples` repo you'll find the current set. If you write a particularly good example then please send it to us.

Browser and run the examples online at the [Phaser Example Gallery][online-examples]. Developers working with local Phaser builds or a local example repository can use the [Phaser Examples Playground][playgroud] development environment.


## Contributing

- If you find a bug in an example then please report it on [GitHub Issues][issues] or our [Support Forum][forum].

- You can issue Pull Requests for new examples or fixes to existing ones against the `master` branch.

- If you have a feature request, or have written a game or demo that shows Phaser in use, then please get in touch. We'd love to hear from you! Either post to our [forum][forum] or email: rich@photonstorm.com


## Bugs?

Please add them to the [Issue Tracker][issues] with as much info as possible, especially source code demonstrating the issue.


## About Phaser

Phaser is a fast, free and fun open source game framework for making desktop and mobile browser HTML5 games. It uses [Pixi.js][pixi] internally for fast 2D Canvas and WebGL rendering.
